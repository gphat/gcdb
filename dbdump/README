MySQL:

db-dump is a dump with a bit of test data.

raw-dump is just the tables and configuration information.

The others are patches, feed these to your db's for upgrading
from prior versions of gcdb.

PostgreSQL:

raw.pgsql is just for initializing your db for the first time.
          This script will destroy all previous data, if any.
